## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWASP-BLT/OWASP-Wich.git
cd OWASP-Wich
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. (Optional) Set up GitHub token for higher API rate limits:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

Basic usage:
```bash
python compliance_checker.py <repository-url>
```

Examples:
```bash
# Check an OWASP project
python compliance_checker.py https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mastg

# Check with GitHub token
python compliance_checker.py https://github.com/OWASP/BLT --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN

# Output as JSON
python compliance_checker.py https://github.com/OWASP/BLT --json
```

### As a Python Module

```python
from compliance_checker import OWASPComplianceChecker

# Initialize checker
checker = OWASPComplianceChecker(github_token="your_token")

# Run compliance check
results = checker.check_compliance("https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mastg")

# Access results
print(f"Score: {results['score']}/{results['max_score']}")
print(f"Percentage: {results['percentage']}%")

# Check specific categories
for category, data in results['categories'].items():
    print(f"{category}: {data['score']}/{data['max_score']}")
```
